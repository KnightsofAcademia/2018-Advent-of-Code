This repo of solutions is hosted by `<3+n`, KOA's computer science clan on Habitica.  Habitica is an open source productivity platform that applies gamification principles to your real-life habits and goals.  Visit the [Knights of Academia Guild on Habitica](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/e184b286-b369-46c9-ab55-054c3368af33) to participate in our Habitica challenges and a chance to win in-game rewards.


## Participation

Assumes you have:

* Joined the [Knights of Academia Guild on Habitica](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/e184b286-b369-46c9-ab55-054c3368af33)
* Elected to participate in the challenge
* Created a GitHub account

Once you've done that,

1. Fork this repo into your own account
2. Make a folder with your Habitica display name and the language you will implement in.  For example, `NeuralKnight-JavaScript`
3. Do whatever setup you want in that folder.  Treat it like your project root.  For example, a JavaScript project might run `npm init` and exclude node_modules in a .gitignore file.  A README.md would be helpful for other people to run your code
4. Create a folder for each day of the challenge: `day-1/`
5. Submit a pull request with your solutions to the day's problems plus any changes to your project root and we'll add it to the community repo


## Disclaimer

The Advent of Code challenge is by Eric Wastl who is not affiliated with KOA.  Within the Habitica platform, KOA has also created a "challenge" (with an in-game reward) for members to participate in the Advent of Code challenge.  Understanding which challenge the word "challenge" refers to is challenging.  We regret the confusion.
